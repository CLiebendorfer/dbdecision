# dbdecision

This is a small static website that I host on s3 (fronted by cloudfront) available at dbdecision.info.

It currently compares Aurora to DynamoDB but I'd really like to modify it in the future to support dynamically creating these sheets using the databses you select.

Please submit a PR if you feel any of the points are wrong or if you feel it's worth adding additonal information.
